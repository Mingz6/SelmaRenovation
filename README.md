# Selma Renovation Project

## Phase Unknown

### 0. Reroofing
**Description:**
- **Material:** Asphalt shingles
- **Estimated Age:** 17 years old
- **Life Expectancy:** 15-25 years depending on quality
- **Current Status:** Cannot be done during the raining season
- The roof life expectancy is another 2-5 years
- I am still waiting for the re-roofing quote report

**Critical Issues Found:**
1. ⚠️ **CRITICAL - Poor Roof Condition**
   - Multiple patches with poor workmanship
   - Overall quality of asphalt roofing and underlayment appears substandard
   - **Impact:** May be contributing to ceiling water leak in Left Upper Unit
   - **Recommendation:** Replace the roof to prevent further water intrusion
   - **Timeline:** Immediate

2. ⚠️ **Insufficient Ventilation**
   - Currently there are 6 vents (insufficient)
   - Black staining around roof vents from condensation
   - **Cause:** Warm, humid air from attic meets colder exterior air
   - **Impact:** Poor ventilation contributing to mold/mildew in attic
   - **Recommendation:** Need 8-10 vents to prevent mold from happening again
   - **Timeline:** Immediate

3. **Missing Caulking**
   - Caulking missing at the bottom of metal vent
   - **Impact:** Water damage risk
   - **Recommendation:** Repair during reroofing
   - **Timeline:** Immediate

**Maintenance Notes:**
- Flashings should be replaced whenever roof is replaced
- Annual caulking and maintenance recommended
- Roofs can leak unpredictably

**Solar Panels & Battery (Optional):**
- **Solar Panels**: Number of Solar Panels 20/44/74. Cost $26k/$54k/$88k
- **Battery**: 9.6×2 = 19.2kw. Cost $31k×2 = $62k

### 0. Ceiling Water Damage
- Need to fix the ceiling damage
- Should the light bulb installation go in this stage?
- Can I do the light bulb installation for other units?

### 0. Attic Moldy Issue
- When should the moldy issue be taken care of?

## Phase #1

### 1. Networking
Run two cables to each output (bedroom, living room, AP, door, and camera). That's roughly:
- 10 bedrooms = 20 cables
- 4 APs = 8 cables
- 4 living rooms = 8 cables
- 8 entrance doors = 16 cables (Not mandatory but nice to have)
- 4 cameras = 8 cables
- 1 fibre cable between garage

**Total**: Around 60 network cables for the whole house, plus 1 fiber cable.

**Equipment**: 2 Rack cases need to be mounted.

**My Provision**:
- All UniFi devices
- Cut & test all cables
- Keystone and RJ45 connectors

**Contractor Needs**: Fish those cables to the spot and install the Rack Case on the wall.

**Quotes**:
- **Quote 1**: +1 (778) 708-8377
  - $11.8k for cable running, testing, and installation
- **Quote 2**: +1 (778) 899-1561 hikeche@hotmail.com
  - Visited by Michael, quoted $10k including cable running and testing

### 2. Power Upgrade
- Upgrade 100V to 200V on each side
- **Cost**: $7k × 2 = $14k
- **Question**: Power pre-wire for the EV car charger or optionally can do this in the future. Please advise.

### 3. AC Installation - Multi-split VRF
- **System**: Mitsubishi - Ductless Multi-Split Cold Climate Heat pumps system
- **Cost**: $42k × 2 = $84k
- **Configuration**: 
  - 7 heads and 1 branch header box and 1 outdoor unit (4.0T)
  - 3×6k BTU wall mount, and 4×12k unit

**Reminders**:
1. Better to do Green house assessment
2. Do the house insulation
3. There are $40k loan from Natural Resources Canada: https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-efficiency/home-energy-efficiency/canada-greener-homes-initiative/canada-greener-homes-loan

**Question**: Because of the cost, can this be done with the pipe & cables and insulation first? We install the heads and outdoor units later.

### 4. Combi Boiler
- **System**: Navien Combi Boiler System 199,000 BTU
- **Cost**: $11.9k × 2 = $23.8k
- **Question**: Can this boiler be installed somewhere in the corner? I want to save the space for building washroom/storage/hallway here.
- **Reminder**: Make sure enough water pressure to service the usage.
