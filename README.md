## Phase #1

### 1. Networking
Run two cables to each output (bedroom, living room, AP, door, and camera). That's roughly:
- 10 bedrooms = 20 cables
- 4 APs = 8 cables
- 4 living rooms = 8 cables
- 8 entrance doors = 16 cables (Not mandatory but nice to have)
- 4 cameras = 8 cables
- 1 fibre cable between garage

**Total**: Around 60 network cables for the whole house, plus 1 fiber cable.

**Equipment**: 2 Rack cases need to be mounted.

**My Provision**:
- All UniFi devices
- Cut & test all cables
- Keystone and RJ45 connectors

**Contractor Needs**: Fish those cables to the spot and install the Rack Case on the wall.

**Quotes**:
- **Quote 1**: +1 (778) 708-8377
  - $11.8k for cable running, testing, and installation
- **Quote 2**: +1 (778) 899-1561 hikeche@hotmail.com
  - Visited by Michael, quoted $10k including cable running and testing

### 2. Power Upgrade
- Upgrade 100V to 200V on each side
- **Cost**: $7k × 2 = $14k
- **Question**: Power pre-wire for the EV car charger or optionally can do this in the future. Please advise.

### 3. AC Installation - Multi-split VRF
- **System**: Mitsubishi - Ductless Multi-Split Cold Climate Heat pumps system
- **Cost**: $42k × 2 = $84k
- **Configuration**: 
  - 7 heads and 1 branch header box and 1 outdoor unit (4.0T)
  - 3×6k BTU wall mount, and 4×12k unit

**Reminders**:
1. Better to do Green house assessment
2. Do the house insulation
3. There are $40k loan from Natural Resources Canada: https://natural-resources.canada.ca/energy-efficiency/home-energy-efficiency/canada-greener-homes-initiative/canada-greener-homes-loan

**Question**: Because of the cost, can this be done with the pipe & cables and insulation first? We install the heads and outdoor units later.

### 4. Combi Boiler
- **System**: Navien Combi Boiler System 199,000 BTU
- **Cost**: $11.9k × 2 = $23.8k
- **Question**: Can this boiler be installed somewhere in the corner? I want to save the space for building washroom/storage/hallway here.
- **Reminder**: Make sure enough water pressure to service the usage.
